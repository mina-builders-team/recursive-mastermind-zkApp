#### Metric Explanations

- **Avg Time Each Game Step**: Total time taken to complete a game step on average.
- **Avg Deploy & Initialize Time**: Time taken to deploy and initialize the contract.
- **Avg Accept Game Time**: Time taken to accept a game by code breaker.
- **Avg Time To Create Base Proof**: Time taken to create the base proof for recursion.
- **Avg Make Guess Time**: Time taken to make a guess by code breaker.
- **Avg Give Clue Time**: Time taken to give a clue by code master.
- **Avg Submit Game Proof Time**: Time taken to submit the recursive game proof to on-chain.

# Conclusion

Unlike the fully on-chain approach where the game state is stored and changed on-chain in every step, the recursive MastermindZkApp approach allows for both parties to interact with each other off-chain and only submit the final succint proof to the chain that includes all the game steps and the result. This approach significantly reduces the on-chain block time waiting and the cost of transactions.

Mina's block time is around 3 minutes, and that means without recursion it would take at least 6 minutes to complete a game step (making guess and giving clue). With the recursive approach, the time is reduced to around **32 seconds** on average. This improvement is reach significant levels when the game steps increase.
